### Background information
The Icelandic threespine Stickleback fish is a freshwater fish and one of the few vertebrate species endemic (found only in a defined region) to Iceland. Within the Icelandic Stickleback population, there are different species living in different ecological settings - some species live in low elevation, marine water environment that is marked with clear water, whereas others habitatuated in high elevation, glacial lake environment where the water is more murky and opaque.

### Project goal
Since different Stickleback fish species lives in different environment, originated from different marine source, and experience different ecological challenge, we're trying to determine how does that affect the Stickleback fish's sensory "requirement", which is required for them to navigate through the water. The diagram below identify the different species we're working with as well as their habitat

### Gene Expression Analysis
For the sensory "requirement" of the Stickleback fish, we're analyzing the following regions

1. *Optic Tectum* (OT): Forms the roof of the midbrain and is the primary visual center in fishes. It typically receives retinal input and directs the eyes and body toward salient visual features.
2. *Torus Semicircularis* (TS): A midbrain region that contributes to auditory (hearing) perception.

For the differentiating factors (i.e., which factor would result in noticeable difference in the Stickleback gene expression level), we're analyzing the gene expression level on the basis of

- Sex  
- Origin  
- Population  
- Elevation 
- Water turbidity


### Results
We discover that Stickleback fish species that expression level can be best differentiated by the two factors: **elevation** and **water turbidity**. More specifically, species that live at higher elevation in glacial lake or spring will likely have higher gene expression for certain genes in the Optic Tectum (vision) and Torus Semicircularis (hearing) in comparison with those living at lower elevation in spring or marine environment. 

This can be explain by the murky water at higher elevation in glacial lake and high spring, which requires better vision to navigate the opaque environment as well as better auditory sense as it cannot solely relies on its vision, especially in unclear water.
